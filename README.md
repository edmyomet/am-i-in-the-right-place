GPS Fencing using real time data collected from the Neo6m GPS module interfaced to arduino
Note: The GPS data is taken over a very narrow distribution, and thus can be considered as coordinates on a flat plane as opposed to curved plane. Any altitude differences have also been excluded in order to avoid calculation of angular mean, and other parameters. Further commits may expand on this aspect of the classification model
